                    The Challenge
                </h1>
                <h2>Making Applicant Tracking Easier and Faster</h2>
                <h5 class="mt-3">
                    Happyer is a job-recruitment platform based in Hong Kong and Singapore that gives modern job seekers a real-view into jobs and companies by giving full transparency into the work culture, employees and offices through photos, videos, podcasts and blog articles. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the current system, the Happyer team manually manages the client’s job postings and company profile via Webflow CMS. The client company would have to contact the team if they want to make changes, increasing human-error and making it time-consuming for both ends.
                    <br><br>
                    By providing clients with a modified Applicant Tracking System (ATS) UI linked to the Happyer.io job platform, this gives the company's clients full-control over what they display on the platform, to seamlessly track their applicants and onboard them.

                </h1>
                <h5>
                    For this project, I decided to conduct qualitative research methods to ensure the product meets the needs of the users which included user and stakeholder interviews and usability testing. To start, I asked the CEO and the team in charge of the manual system the following questions: 
                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-5 text-center" style="color: #5B5B5B">
                    "Who are the primary users?"</br>
                    "What types of industries are Happyer's clients from?"</br>
                    "What are the functionality goals of UI? What goals do we want to achieve?"</br>  
                    "What problems do we face in the current ATS system?"</h5>
                <h5 class="mt-5">These questions helped me give a better idea of Happyer's business model and better understand the problem I need to tackle when designing the UI.

                    I conducted  remote interviews to understand what users are generally looking for when using an Applicant Tracking System or when recruiting applicant in a general manner.

                    <br><br>
                    Since this project was done during CoVID-19, the interviews were held on Google Meet where I asked them questions such as:

                    Based on our user interviews and research, we have identified our target users: <strong>Recruiters, Hiring Managers, Executives from startups and mid-scale companies, and Administrators from Happyer </strong>.

                    I found this step the most exciting as it was my first time designing a dashboard system. The layout of the ATS was crucial given recruiters will be spending the majority of their time at work using the ATS, which made the design process challenging. I eventually recovered from this hump by referring to the previous user interviews and by consulting with the team during each major step to generate more feedback. In the end, I focused on simple yet modern visuals to place emphasis on major figures and information.

                </h1>
                <h5 class="mt-3">
                    I ended my internship on the first week of August 2020 and had to turnover the designs to the Developer team as my classes were about to begin at my university. 
                    <br><br>
                    I found this project to be the most valuable one as I got to experience leading a UX project on my own and conducting user research for the first time! From the user research, I learned the value of understanding the user's needs before hopping onto the designs while having the ability to translate them to actual features on a product. This can be achieved by asking them the right questions that actually make them think, such as “what is your first impression of this product? If you had a magic wand, what would you change?”. 
                    <br><br>
                    The fact that my internship was done during CoVID-19 in Hong Kong also made it especially unique as the majority of it was done remotely. I had to learn how to work remotely with a colleague, Oscar Sun, that lived in Seattle, USA, which led to some difficulties in communicating our ideas. Eventually, we managed to come up with an effective work system where we updated one another on Slack and held regular meetings in the morning on Google Meet. Leaving comments on Figma seemed to help us out as well.                 </h5>
